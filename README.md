# 🦀 Rust by Example - Practice Repository

Welcome to my Rust practice repository! This project contains hands-on examples and exercises to learn Rust programming concepts through practical implementation.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

This repository covers fundamental Rust concepts including:

- Basic syntax and control flow
- Ownership and borrowing
- Structs, enums, and pattern matching
- Error handling
- Collections and iterators
- Traits and generics
- Concurrency and threading
- Testing and documentation
